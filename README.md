# Lung-Cancer-Prediction-ML-Project

To run the code, follow these steps:
1.	Make sure you have Python and the necessary dependencies installed (Flask, numpy, pickle, flask_navigation).
2.	Save the code in a Python file with a ".py" extension (e.g., "lung_cancer_prediction.py").
3.	Place the "model.pkl" file in the same directory as the Python file.
4.	Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory containing the Python file.
5.	Run the command python lung_cancer_prediction.py to start the Flask application.
6.	Once the application is running, open a web browser and go to http://localhost:8000/ to access the prediction page.
